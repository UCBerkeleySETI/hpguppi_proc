Simulated data and coefficients library

To compile the test code and generate simulated RAW and BFR5 files, use the following command:

`gcc sim_raw_bfr5_files.c sim_data_coeff.c -o sim_raw_bfr5_files -lm -lhdf5`

To compile the test code and generate binary files of simulated data and coefficients, use the following command:

`gcc sim_data_coeff_main.c sim_data_coeff.c -o sim_data_coeff -lm`

To learn the different arguments necessary to run the executable/program, use the `-h` or `--help` option.

To analyze the data generated by the executable and written to the data and coefficient binary files, you can use the post-processing script `sim_data_coeff_analysis.py` in the `post_processing` subdirectory. Simply change the `telescope_flag` (`MK` or `VLA`) and `mode_flag` (`1k`, `4k`, or `32k` for MK and `req` or `des` for VLA) variables in the script. 
Arguments to the python script were not used in order to enable plotting with VS code while connecting to remote server over SSH.
